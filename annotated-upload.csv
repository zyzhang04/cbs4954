return to HiFi. Conventional vent attempted as well. Infant
was placed on a Fentanyl drip and got a dose of Pavulon.
Infant eventually placed back on HiFi where she remains at
this time. LS remain course and diminished with IC/SC
retractions. Several blood gases obtained this shift, see RT
note for details.

CV: No murmur appreciated. Infant received 2nd dose of
Indocin for 3mm PDA via echo ([**Name8 (MD) **] NNP). Infant remains on
Dopamine, cuff BP's remain stable with means mostly between
30-50. Infant finished blood transfusion this shift of
15cc/kg for Hct 29.9. Repeat Hct this shift was 30.0 - MD &
NNP aware.

FEN: Infant remains NPO with DLUVC in place. PAL placed by
MD this shift. PND5, D5W, Dopamine & Fentanyl infusing via
DLUVC. 1/2NS infusing via PAL. Abdomen soft/flat, bowel
sounds not audible. D/S 131, 105 thus far. Voiding
(5.7cc/kg/hr), no stool ever thus far. Lytes drawn x2 thus
far. NaCl bolus given for low sodium. Plan to recheck lytes
in AM.

G/D: Temp remained stable throughout shift nested in
sheepskin on radiant warmer. Eyes remain fused. Quite
irritable at times, Fentanyl PRN given x2 then Fentanyl drip
started. Pavulon given x2 thus far as well. Aquaphor ordered
to skin PRN. Skin translucent, but intact. Small bruises
noted on ankles. Plan to repeat HUS on Friday ([**Name8 (MD) **] NNP, last
HUS WNL).

PARENTS: Mom in with visitors at beginning of shift. NNP
spoke with Mom during respiratory event and Mom and her
sister came to visit. Mom updated at bedside by RN, NNP &
MD. Dad came in from home and was too updated by team. Once

Baby [**Name (NI) 4**] ([**Known lastname **]) [**Known lastname **] is a 28 [**4-23**] week gestation infant (according to due dat of [**2147-7-13**]).  He was [**Date Range **] by C-section to a 41yo Mom who is G-2 now P-2 for bleeding.  Mom had [**Name2 (NI) 2369**] at 18 wks which was followed by PROM and placenta previa.  Mom was on bedrest and followed and then presented again with PROM.  Mom received Beta.

Baby was [**Name2 (NI) **] with apgars of 6,6 and 7 at 1,5 and 10 minutes of life.  Infant cried and had HR >100 but had poor color and perfusion and fair tone.  Infant was noted to spit up blood with attempted intubation in OR.  ( Mom had [**Name2 (NI) 2543**] and there was blood in amniotic fluid that infant swallowed.)  Blood was found by in stomach by sxn, no blood in lungs.  Infant was intubated in OR after several attempts and was transferred to NICU in heated isolette after breif visit at Mom's bedside.

In NICU infant had normal vitals except for O2 Sat.  Hand bagging took much effort with litte increase in O2 Sats.  Decision was made to start Nitric Oxide with HFOV as life saving measure for this atypical 28 weeker who appeared to present with significant pulmonary HTN.  Infant showed remarkable improvement in both pre and post ductal sats moments after NO started.  Infant has had several blood gases and has been treated accordingly.
Echo showed no cardiac abnormalities.  Infant BP began to drop and was started on Dobutamine and then Dopamine with improvement.  Infant received several NS boluses as well before Dopa and Dobuta.
Infant started on TF of 100cc/kg/d of D10w via PIV.  Received D10 bolus for low 2nd Dstick with good results.  UAC and DLUVC placed.  IVF then switched to those lines.  Currently [**12-19**] NaAcetate w/ 1/2u heparin/cc via UAC,  D10W w/[**12-19**] u hep/cc via primary port and Starter TPN D10 via secondary port.  Infant remains NPO and has voided.  Abd exam benign.
Blood cx and CBC w/diff drawn and sent.  No shift.  Started on Amp/Gent.
Infant received several doses of Pavulon and Fentanyl for comfort and sedation to better treat him.  Infant now on Fentanyl drip.
Infant has stable temp on open warmer.  Infant is nested on sheepskin with boundries for comfort and positioning during sedation.

This infant has gone up and down on both sats and BP's throughout the day, meds and vent setting have been adjusted to meet infant needs.  Infant has also had to be hand bagged multiple times to rescue him from decreasing Sat's.  Several Xrays have been done of chest and abdomen to evaluate clinical status and tube and line placement.  Changes have been made as needed.

This infant remains critical and unstable.  MD, NNP, RNs and RT's will continue to monitor closely and treat infant as needed.
